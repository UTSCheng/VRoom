# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Enhance server-side color logging and validation
  - Add comprehensive logging to the color generation process in server.js
  - Add validation to ensure all cube colors are properly stored in the objects array
  - Add logging to the initialState message transmission to verify color data is included
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 2. Improve client-side color application with error handling
  - Add detailed logging to the color application process in the initialState handler
  - Add validation to verify that color values are properly received and applied
  - Implement error handling for cases where color application fails
  - Add logging to track successful vs failed color applications
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [ ] 3. Add color synchronization verification system
  - Create a function to verify that applied colors match the server's authoritative data
  - Add client-side validation that compares material colors with received color data
  - Implement logging for color mismatch detection
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.3, 3.3_

- [ ] 4. Implement color resync mechanism
  - Add a new WebSocket message type for requesting color resync from server
  - Create server handler for color resync requests that sends fresh color data
  - Implement client-side resync request functionality for when colors don't match
  - Add fallback color handling for when resync fails
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 3.4_

- [ ] 5. Add comprehensive error logging and debugging
  - Enhance server logging to include color data in all relevant WebSocket messages
  - Add client-side debugging information for color-related operations
  - Implement error reporting for color synchronization failures
  - Create debugging utilities to help identify color sync issues
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 6. Create automated tests for color synchronization
  - Write unit tests for the color generation function to ensure consistent output
  - Create integration tests that verify color data transmission between server and client
  - Add tests for error handling scenarios and resync mechanisms
  - Implement tests for multiple client color consistency
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2_
