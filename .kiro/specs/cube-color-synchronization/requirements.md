# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the critical issue where cubes in the multiplayer 3D environment display different colors across different clients, breaking the shared experience. Analysis of the current codebase reveals that while the server generates and stores cube colors correctly, there are potential synchronization gaps in how these colors are transmitted to and applied by clients.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user connecting to a multiplayer session, I want to see exactly the same cube colors as all other users, so that we can collaborate and communicate effectively about specific objects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client connects to the server THEN the system SHALL send complete color data for all cubes in the initialState message
2. WHEN the client receives the initialState THEN the system SHALL immediately apply the server-provided colors to all cube objects
3. WHEN cube colors are applied THEN the system SHALL verify that each cube's material color matches the server's authoritative color data
4. IF a cube's color data is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL log an error and request a color resync

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user already in a session, I want new users joining to see identical cube colors to mine, so that we maintain visual consistency throughout the session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server initializes THEN the system SHALL generate cube colors once and store them as the single source of truth
2. WHEN multiple clients are connected THEN the system SHALL ensure all clients display identical colors for each cube
3. WHEN a client processes color updates THEN the system SHALL handle both hex color values and Three.js color objects correctly
4. WHEN color synchronization occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain the original color assignment throughout the entire session

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer debugging color synchronization issues, I want comprehensive logging and error handling, so that I can quickly identify and resolve any color inconsistencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server sends initialState THEN the system SHALL log the color data being transmitted for each cube
2. WHEN a client applies colors THEN the system SHALL log successful color applications and any failures
3. WHEN color mismatches are detected THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information including cube IDs and expected vs actual colors
4. WHEN the system encounters color-related errors THEN the system SHALL implement fallback mechanisms to maintain basic functionality
